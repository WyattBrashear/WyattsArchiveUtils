# Wyatt's Archive format for Multipurpose Use
this is a project i made (Mostly out of boredom) to make my own archive format. It is pretty much just a Tarball but
under a different name. 

# Benchmarks
I know this is what most of you are here for. These tests were done on a 2024 M3 Macbook Air with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of Storage (312/494 GB Used).
## Linux Codebase (As of 2/28/2026 @ 11:19 PM) (Clone depth = 1) (1.87 GB)
https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
Seeing as the linux codebase changes about once every 30 minutes i cant just say "Linux Codebase". So here is the
performance of the program to create an archive for it and reconstruct it.

Writing: 15.44 Seconds
Reconstruction: 1200.21 seconds
